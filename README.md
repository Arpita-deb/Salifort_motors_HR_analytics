# Salifort Motors HR Analytics - What will make them stick?
## Capstone Project from Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificated course

## Introduction:
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer to you as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on your understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?
Your goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

## Methodologies used:
logistic regression model or the following machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, XGBoost

# (P)ACE - PLAN - UNDERSTANDING THE DATA IN THE PROBLEM CONTEXT

## About the Company:
Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifort’s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.    

## Key Stakeholders:
Salifort’s senior leadership team
Human Resources (HR) department team

## Statement of the Business Task:
design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other relevant data points. A good model will help the company increase retention and job satisfaction for current employees, and save money and time training new employees. analyze the key factors driving employee turnover, build an effective model, and share recommendations for next steps with the leadership team. 

## Deliverables:
1. An executive summary with important insights and recommendation
2. A jupyter notebook with all the codes
   
## Data Dictionary:
turnover data includes both employees who choose to quit their job and employees who are let go.
